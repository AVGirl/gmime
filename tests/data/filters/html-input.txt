This is a sample message body with some embedded urls such as Google's
search page at www.google.com. Did it capture that last period? I hope
not! How about ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ or even an email address
like fejj@gnome.org? It should also work with mailto urls. Let's try
it, shall we? We can use mailto:fejj@gnome.org as a simple case...

We should also check that GMimeFilterHTML is able to detect full urls
like https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime - GMime's very own website!

Or file://localhost/dev/null file URLs.

And how about quoting? Let's give that a try...

> This is one level of quoting
> > And this is two levels of quoting
> > Yet more text that is quoted twice...
> This is back down to one level...
> > > And this is three levels! WOW! CRAZY!
Okay, let's not get too carried away...

Did that work as expected?
