This is a sample message body with some embedded urls such as Google's
search page at www.google.com. Did it capture that last period? I hope
not! How about ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/ or even an email address
like fejj@gnome.org? It should also work with mailto urls. Let's try
it, shall we? We can use mailto:fejj@gnome.org as a simple case...

We should also check that GMimeFilterHTML is able to detect full urls
like https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime - GMime's very own website!

Or file://localhost/dev/null file URLs.

GMime's URL scanner should also work more complex urls:

- addr-spec w/ domain literal: fejj@[127.0.0.1]
- web url w/ domain literal: http://[127.0.0.1]/index.html
- web url w/ username: http://user@domain.com/index.html
- web url w/ user & pass: http://user:pass@domain.com:80/index.html
- web url w/ user and domain literal: http://user@[127.0.0.1]/index.html
- web url surrounded by []'s: [http://www.google.com/]
- web url surrounded by ()'s: (http://www.google.com/)
- web url surrounded by {}'s: {http://www.google.com/}
- web url surrounded by <>'s: <http://www.google.com/>
- web url with brackets: http://www.google.com/symbols.(123){1}[2].html

And how about quoting? Let's give that a try...

> This is one level of quoting
> > And this is two levels of quoting
> > Yet more text that is quoted twice...
> This is back down to one level...
> > > And this is three levels! WOW! CRAZY!
Okay, let's not get too carried away...

Did that work as expected?
