This is a sample message body with some embedded urls such as Google's<br>
search page at <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a>. Did it capture that last period? I hope<br>
not! How about <a href="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/">ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/</a>&nbsp;or even an email address<br>
like <a href="mailto:fejj@gnome.org">fejj@gnome.org</a>? It should also work with mailto urls. Let's try<br>
it, shall we? We can use <a href="mailto:fejj@gnome.org">mailto:fejj@gnome.org</a>&nbsp;as a simple case...<br>
<br>
We should also check that GMimeFilterHTML is able to detect full urls<br>
like <a href="https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime">https://github.com/jstedfast/gmime</a>&nbsp;- GMime's very own website!<br>
<br>
Or <a href="file://localhost/dev/null">file://localhost/dev/null</a>&nbsp;file URLs.<br>
<br>
And how about quoting? Let's give that a try...<br>
<br>
<blockquote class="level_001">This is one level of quoting<br>
<blockquote class="level_002">And this is two levels of quoting<br>
Yet more text that is quoted twice...<br>
</blockquote>This is back down to one level...<br>
<blockquote class="level_002"><blockquote class="level_003">And this is three levels! WOW! CRAZY!<br>
</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>Okay, let's not get too carried away...<br>
<br>
Did that work as expected?<br>
