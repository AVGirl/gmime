    <title>Filing a bug report or feature request</title>
    <para>
If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in GMime, please
file a bug report at 
<ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">http://bugzilla.gnome.org</ulink>. 
We'd also appreciate reports of incomplete or misleading information in 
the GMime documentation; file those against the &quot;docs&quot; component of the 
&quot;gmime&quot; product in Bugzilla.
</para>
    <para>
The bug tracker should definitely be used for feature requests, it's
not only for bugs. We track all GMime development in Bugzilla, so it's
the way to be sure the GMime developers won't forget about an issue.

    <title>Submitting Patches</title>
    <para>
If you develop a bugfix or enhancement for GMime, please file that in
Bugzilla as well. Bugzilla allows you to attach files; please attach a
patch generated by the <command>diff</command> utility, using the 
<option>-u</option> option to make the patch more readable. All patches 
must be offered under the terms of the GNU GPL license, so be sure you 
are authorized to give us the patch under those terms.
</para>
    <para>
If you want to discuss your patch before or after developing it, mail
<ulink url="mailto:fejj@ximian.com">fejj@ximian.com</ulink>.  But be
sure to file the Bugzilla report as well this way it's likely to slip
through the cracks.
