HISTORY
-------

As a developer and user of Electronic Mail clients, I had come to
realize that the vast majority of E-Mail client solutions had
less-than-satisfactory MIME implementations. More often than not these
E-Mail clients created broken MIME messages and/or would incorrectly
try to parse a MIME message thus subtracting from the full benefits
that MIME was meant to provide. GMime is meant to address this issue
by following the MIME specification as closely as possible while also
providing programmers with an extremely easy to use application
programming interface.
