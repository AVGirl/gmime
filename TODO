The following is a list of known places for possible improvement to
the GMime library. This list of tasks in no way indicates priority,
that is to say that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that the
tasks are presented in.

GMime 3.0 Planning:
===================

- Rewrite GMimeReferences into a GObject and split into its own file

- Add g_mime_utils_header_decode_[text,phrase]() variants that also return charset/lang values?


Future Planning:
================

- Modify GMimeStream APIs to take GCancellable and GError arguments.

- Modify GMimeParser APIs to take GCancellable and GError arguments.

- Modify write_to_stream() methods to take GCancellable and GError arguments.
