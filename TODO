The following is a list of known places for possible improvement to
the GMime library. This list of tasks in no way indicates priority,
that is to say that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that the
tasks are presented in.



- Possibly make the GMime parser async.

- Write a broken date parser. (job for lex/bison?)

- modify address parser:

<charles> on usenet it's not uncommon to have header like "From: Joe Bob"
<charles> where people use no address at all to avoid spammers
<fejj> ok
<charles> It would be nice if internet-address handled this
<charles> have ->name == "Joe Bob" and ->value.addr == NULL
<fejj> oh, so only support writing them? ah, that should be easy
<charles> It looks like the else clause on line 582 is where a "Joe Bob" string fails
<fejj> I was pondering how I could possibly parse that as a name :)
<charles> No, I am asking about parsing
<fejj> oh
<charles> It would be nice for internet_address_parse_string() to return an InternetAddress with a name of "Joe Bob" and a NULL addr
<fejj> ah, okay
<fejj> I guess I can do that
<fejj> I'll have to modify my internet_address_to_string code to handle that too
<fejj> but that should be easy
