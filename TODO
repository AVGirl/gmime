The following is a list of known places for possible improvement to
the GMime library. This list of tasks in no way indicates priority,
that is to say that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that the
tasks are presented in.

GMime 3.0 Planning:
===================

- Convert GMimeParam[List] into GObjects

- Convert GMimeHeader[List] into GObjects

- Rewrite GMimeReferences into a GObject and split into its own file

- Rename g_mime_content_type_to_string() to g_mime_content_type_get_mime_type()

- Add g_mime_content_type_encode()

- Rename g_mime_content_disposition_to_string() to g_mime_content_disposition_encode()

- Fix GMimeObject's content_type_changed() and content_disposition_changed handlers to
  use the new g_mime_*_encode() functions and update both the value and raw_value of
  their respective headers.

- Add g_mime_utils_header_decode_[text,phrase]() variants that also return charset/lang values?


Future Planning:
================

- Modify GMimeStream APIs to take GCancellable and GError arguments.

- Modify GMimeParser APIs to take GCancellable and GError arguments.

- Modify write_to_stream() methods to take GCancellable and GError arguments.
