The following is a list of known places for possible improvement to
the GMime library. This list of tasks in no way indicates priority,
that is to say that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that the
tasks are presented in.



- rfc2047 encode parameters in the MIME Content fields where
appropriate. This means we can't always wrap parameter values in
quotes (it is illegal to quote rfc2047 encoded atoms).

- Expand InternetAddress to correctly handle rfc0822 address 'groups'
(Are these even in use still?).

- Possibly make the GMime parser async.

- Write a broken date parser. (job for lex/bison?)


FIXME's:

- Parsing quoted strings needs to be smarter - need to check for
escaped quotes and such.

- InternetAddress needs to be smarter about quoting an address - what
if the name component of the address has embedded quotes? They need to
be escaped.
