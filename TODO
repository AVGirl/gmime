The following is a list of known places for possible improvement to
the GMime library. This list of tasks in no way indicates priority,
that is to say that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that the
tasks are presented in.

GMime 3.0 Planning:
===================

- Drop GMime-Sharp support? Not sure it's worth maintaining now that
  I've written MimeKit which will always be a far nicer .NET API
  than I could make GMime-Sharp.

- How about a g_mime_part_get_best_charset()? This one could be
  awkward since it depends on the content being text and also encoded
  in UTF-8... Maybe this calls for a GMimeTextPart? [ CONSIDERING ]

- Combine GMimeGpgContext and GMimePkcs7Context by using GpgMe for
  both. This could allow g_mime_multipart_encrypted_decrypt() and
  g_mime_multipart_signed_verify() to set the appropriate protocol on
  the CryptoContext so that the caller wouldn't have to figure that
  out themselves. We'd actually be able to get rid of the need for
  a GMimeCryptoContext parameter altogether if we could rely on
  the backend using a gpg-agent for password requests.


Future Planning:
================

- Modify GMimeStream APIs to take GCancellable and GError arguments.

- Modify GMimeParser APIs to take GCancellable and GError arguments.

- Modify write_to_stream() methods to take GCancellable and GError arguments.
