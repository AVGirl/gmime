The following is a list of known places for possible improvement to
the GMime library. This list of tasks in no way indicates priority,
that is to say that there is no rhyme or reason to the order that the
tasks are presented in.


- better handling of invalid raw 8bit headers. need to somehow provide
a way for the app to tell gmime how to handle these. perhaps a
callback set on the parser object that gets called if gmime fails to
be able to convert i to UTF-8 (after trying locale charset of course).

- have gmime-filter-charset auto-detect windows charsets and change
the iconv_t if/when needed? will this work?

- implement gmime-filter-windows-charset to auto-detect if the text is
actually windows-cp125x?

- Fix multipart/signed support so that verifying signatures will feed
the complete signed-part in raw format (ie, without reformatting
Content-* headers) to gpg. Currently I only feed the raw content of
the signed part to gpg but the headers have been processed by GMime
and so *may* be folded differently from the original Content-*
headers.

- make thread-safe. some stuff already is, like the gmime-iconv code
and some of the other charset stuff. Streams, however, are not.

- Possibly make the GMime parser incremental.

- modify address parser:

<charles> on usenet it's not uncommon to have header like "From: Joe Bob"
<charles> where people use no address at all to avoid spammers
<fejj> ok
<charles> It would be nice if internet-address handled this
<charles> have ->name == "Joe Bob" and ->value.addr == NULL
<fejj> oh, so only support writing them? ah, that should be easy
<charles> It looks like the else clause on line 582 is where a "Joe Bob" string fails
<fejj> I was pondering how I could possibly parse that as a name :)
<charles> No, I am asking about parsing
<fejj> oh
<charles> It would be nice for internet_address_parse_string() to return an 
InternetAddress with a name of "Joe Bob" and a NULL addr
<fejj> ah, okay
<fejj> I guess I can do that
<fejj> I'll have to modify my internet_address_to_string code to handle that too
<fejj> but that should be easy
